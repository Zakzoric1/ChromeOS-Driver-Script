# Compatibility
I haven't tested it with anything else other then Ubuntu 24.10
**BUT** the scripts use apt a debian package manager to install git which is needed to get the packages, so sorry anyone who can't use apt. But the process is so easy I'd say this is over-simplying it.

# How I got the idea
Well just today in the time of writing this I got an idea, I remembered seeing some scripts that were made for [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) when searching for scripts that could install wine on my device. But I thought what if there was a script like that for the driver scripts **SURE** it's a pretty pointless idea. But hey! I did it!
